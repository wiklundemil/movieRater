## This is a project for a course called Design of dynamic web systems, the project is used for learing and how to create api's with the use of django and python.

Our project were to create some social way of sharing and give rating on movies. We therefore used the api's from TMDB (the movie data base) for this project.
Within this project a user should be able to create a post for a specific movie that users later could give comments and a rating. 

The list of aviable api's that one can try out are:
